## 1. Detection Performance

### Detection method

* Main body
* Extension cable

------

## 2. Features

### IP Rate

* IP66

### Remote setting and testing

* Setting and testing from RB Link App

### Advanced features

* Power up enrolling
  *When sensor is powered up, it will automatically start paring to the hub nearby*
* Find me
  *When enabled, the sensor starts flashing green, which can help identify the sensor from numerous devices.*
* Signal strength detection
  *When enabled, senor starts flashing green/orange/red showing the wireless signal strength between the hub at current installation site.* 
* Low battery notification

### Indicator

* Alarm: Flashing Red
* Find me: Flashing Green
* Signal strength: Flashing Green / Orange / Red
  *Flashing Green: signal strength is strong, and is recommended to install device here*
  *Flashing Orange: signal strength is medium and device can be installed here*
  *Flashing Red: signal strength is bad or no signal, and device can not be installed here*

## 3. RBF wireless technology

### Wireless signal range

* Up to **1,600 m** in an open space with hub
* Two-way communication with hub

### Frequency bands

* 868 MHz Water Leak Detector: 863 ~ 870 MHz
* 915 MHz Water Leak Detector: 902 ~ 928 MHz
  *Depends on sales region.*

### Wireless signal modulation

* FSK / DSSS

### Encrypted communication

* All the data transmitted are protected by AES-CCM encryption with a random key.

### Frequency hopping (FHSS)

* To prevent radio interference and radio signal interception.

### Time division multiple access (TDMA)

* With the help of clock synchronization technology, hub will slice time into different division for different RBF wireless devices. In this way, all devices will communicate with hub in a sequence.
