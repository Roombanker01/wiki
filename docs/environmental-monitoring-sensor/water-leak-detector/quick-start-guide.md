## 4. Testing Instruction

**Signal Strength Test**

This step checks that the signal strength of the communication between the device at its current location and the Home Security Hub.

1. Click the " ![资源 15@4x](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%2015@4x.png) "button in the top right corner of the water leak detector details page.
2. Click on "**Signal Strength Test**".
3. Click the " ![资源 16@4x](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%2016@4x.png) " button to check the result of signal strength test.
