## 6. Precautions

1. Mount the product only on indoor ceilings.  
2. Install the product at least 50 cm away from lighting products.  
3. Do not install the product in bathrooms or other moist environments.
4. Do not install the product in places with non-fire smoke or steam.  
5. Ensure that the temperature of the installation environment is within the range of ‒10°C to +55°C.
6. If a cupboard is near the ceiling, install the product at least 60 cm away from the cupboard.
7. Install the product at least 150 cm away from ventilators, air conditioners, and air vents.
8. You are advised to use screws to install the product. If you use a 3M sticker to install it, any product damage or safety accidents incurred therefrom will be your responsibility.
9. If you choose to use a 3M sticker, affix the product to a smooth, even, dry, and clean surface.
10. Regularly check whether the product is attached to the surface securely to prevent it from falling down.
11. The product cannot be mounted to the mounting base unless the battery is installed.
12. If you affix the product to a painted surface, peeling of the paint may cause the product to fall down. If this occurs, you are liable for any problems incurred therefrom.

## 7. Fire Alarm Function  

1. When the product detects smoke, it immediately sends audible and visual alarm signals.

2. In case of fire, take proper measures immediately. For example, call the fire emergency number, or use a fire extinguisher to put out the fire.

3. If there is no fire, press the mute/self-diagnostic button to mute the product.

   **Note: The product will be mute for 90s. During this period, the product will not generate any audible or visual alarm. After 90s, the product will be restored to the detection state.*

4. The product will generate a fire alarm when the following items contact it directly:

   1. Mist sprayed from pesticides or cosmetics  
   2. Smoke generated by cigarettes and incense sticks  
   3. Smoke-type or thermal evaporation-type pesticides  
   4. Cooking smoke or steam  
   5. Condensation  

## 8. Alarm and Test

1. Detection state: The status indicator blinks red at 50s intervals.

2. Self-checking state: When you press the mute/self-checking button, the status indicator will turn red. If you press and hold the mute/self- diagnostic button for less than 5s, the product will enter the self-checking state, the status indicator will flash red, and the buzzer will beep (same as in alarm state).

   ![Smoke-13](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/Smoke-13.png)

   1. When the smoke density reaches the preset alarm threshold, the product generates an alarm.
   2. During self-checking test, keep away from the buzzer to avoid loud alarm sound from damaging your hearing.
   3. If the product generate an alarm when it is monitoring, potential risks may exist. Do not ignore the alarm and try to locate the cause.

**IMPORTANT**

Ignoring the alarm could result in property damage, personal injury, or even death. If the product fails a test, see "Troubleshooting" to rectify the fault. If the fault persists, replace the product immediately.  

## 9. Mute Function

If the product generates an alarm, potential risks may exist. Before you mute the product, ensure that there is no fire. Do not block the product or disable it in any way. If you do so, the product can no longer provide you with protection.

If the product generates an alarm because it detects smoke in the kitchen but not a fire (for example, bacon frying), press the mute/self-diagnostic button on the panel to mute the product.  

When the product is muted, the status indicator will rapidly blink red. The product sensitivity will be restored automatically within 90s.  

**Note: If the smoke density surrounding the product is still high, the product will generate an alarm again. Open the door and window to let out the smoke.*

If you do not know the cause for the alarm, try to locate the source of the smoke, as ignoring the alarm could result in property damage, personal injury, or even death.

## 10. Routine Maintenance  

The product has a maintenance-free design. You only need to perform the following routine operations to ensure that the product works properly.

1. Suggest to test the product at least once every week. For details on how to test the product, see "**Alarm and Test**".

2. Keep the product clean and remove dust from it with a vacuum cleaner and soft brush at least once every year.

   ![Smoke-14](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/Smoke-14.png)

Use a cotton cloth or sponge to clean the product. Do not use solvents or detergents, which may enter the product and cause damage to the sensor or circuit.

**Note: Do not paint your product. The paint may block smoke intake vents of the product, causing the product to malfunction.*

## 11. Troubleshooting  

If the product malfunctions, its battery may have reached its valid lifespan or the product may be affected by dust, smoke residue, or other dirt. If this is the case, refer to "Routine Maintenance" for instructions on cleaning the product. If the fault persists, perform the following operations:  

1. If the product does not respond, check whether the product is correctly mounted to the mounting base.
2. If the product intermittently beeps (at about 40s intervals), the battery level is low. Replace the battery within one week.
3. If you often encounter non-fire alarm, please try to relocate your smoke alarm.
4. If the product generates alarms frequently when there is no fire or smoke, clean the product or reinstall the product in another position.

**IMPORTANT**

If the fault persists after you perform the preceding operations, contact the local vendor. Do not disassemble the product yourself, or the warranty service for the product will become invalid.
