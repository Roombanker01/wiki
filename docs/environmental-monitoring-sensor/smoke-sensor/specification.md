## 3.  wireless technology

### RBF

#### Wireless signal range

* Up to **1,900 m** in an open space with hub
* Two-way communication with hub

#### Frequency bands

* 868 MHz Monitor: 863 ~ 870 MHz
* 915 MHz Monitor: 902 ~ 928 MHz  
  
  > *Depends on sales region.*

#### Wireless signal modulation

* FSK / DSSS

#### Encrypted communication

* All the data transmitted are protected by AES-CCM encryption with a random key.

#### Frequency hopping (FHSS)

* To prevent radio interference and radio signal interception.

#### Time division multiple access (TDMA)

* With the help of clock synchronization technology, hub will slice time into different division for different RBF wireless devices. In this way, all devices will communicate with hub in a sequence

### Zigbee 

#### Wireless signal range
