## RBF wireless technology

### Wireless signal range

* Up to 3,150 m in an open space with hub
* Two-way communication between hub

### Frequency bands

* 868 MHz, 915 MHz, 433 MHz
  *Depends on sales region.*

### Maximum effective radiated power

* Up to 20 dBm
  Featured automatic power control to reduce power consumption and noise interference.

### Wireless signal modulation

* FSK / DSSS

### Encrypted communication

* All the data transmitted are protected by AES-CCM encryption with a random key.

### Frequency hopping (FHSS)

* To prevent radio interference and radio signal interception.

### Time division multiple access (TDMA)

* With the help of clock synchronization technology, hub will slice time into different division for different RBF wireless devices. In this way, all devices will communicate with hub in a sequence.
