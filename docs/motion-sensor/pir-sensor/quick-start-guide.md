## 3. Add PIR Sensor 

Please make sure you have logged into the RB Link App and completed adding the home security hub before adding peripheral.

1. Click Home Security Hub to enter peripheral page, then click "**+**" on the top right corner and select "**Add peripheral**" to enable enrollment mode.

2. Power up the PIR sensor by removing the insulator from the device . The green indicator will start flashing continuously and the device will automatically show up in the App interface.

   **Note: if the device does not show up in the App interface until green indicator is off, please press and hold the device register button for 5s to try again.*

3. Assign room for the PIR sensor and click the "**Done**" button ，the PIR sensor is added successfully.

## 4. Testing Instruction

**Signal Strength Test**

This step checks that the signal strength of the communication between the device at its current location and the Home Security Hub.

1. Click the " ![资源 15@4x](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%2015@4x.png) "button in the top right corner of the PIR sensor details page.
2. Click on "**Signal Strength Test**".
3. Click the " ![资源 16@4x](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%2016@4x.png) " button to check the result of signal strength test.
