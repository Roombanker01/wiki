## 2. Wireless communication

### RBF communication technology

Innovative and Proprietary wireless communication technology to transmit information.

Key features:

* Ultra-long communication range.(Up to 3.5km@open area)
* Two-way communication.
* AES-CCM encryption featuring a random key.
* OTA by wireless.
* Instant notifications.
* Remote control via RB Link App.

### Frequency bands

* **868 MHz version**: 863 ~ 870 MHz
* **915 MHz version**: 902 ~ 928 MHz  
  *Depends on sales region.*

### Wireless signal modulation

* FSK / DSSS

### Wireless signal range

* Up to **3,500m** in open space  
  Between the hub and connected devices.  
  *Maximum range depends on the connected device.*

### Encrypted communication

All the data transmitted are protected by AES-CCM encryption with a random key.

### Frequency hopping (FHSS)

* up to 50 channels available to prevent radio interference and radio signal interception.

### Time division multiple access (TDMA)

* With the help of clock synchronization technology, hub will slice time into different division for different RBF wireless devices. In this way, all devices will communicate with hub in a sequence.
