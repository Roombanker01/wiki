## 2. Wireless communication

### RBF communication technology

Innovative and Proprietary wireless communication technology to transmit information.

Key features:
* Ultra-long communication range.(Up to 3.5km@open area)
* Two-way communication.
* AES-CCM encryption featuring a random key.
* OTA by wireless.
* Instant notifications.
* Remote control via RB Link App.



### Frequency bands
* RBGW-101-868: 863 ~ 870 MHz

* RBGW-101-915: 902 ~ 928 MHz
  *Depends on sales region.*

  
### Wireless signal modulation
* FSK / DSSS



### Wireless signal range
* Up to **3,500m** (in open space)
Between the hub and connected devices.
*Maximum range depends on the connected device.*



### Encrypted communication
* All the data transmitted are protected by AES-CCM encryption with a random key.



### Frequency hopping (FHSS)

* Up to **50 channels** available to prevent radio interference and radio signal interception.



### Time division multiple access (TDMA)
* With the help of clock synchronization technology, hub will slice time into different division for different RBF wireless devices. In this way, all devices will communicate with hub in a sequence.
