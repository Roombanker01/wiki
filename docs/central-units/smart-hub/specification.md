## Wireless communication

### RBF communication technology

Innovative and Proprietary wireless communication technology to transmit information.

Key features:

* Ultra-long communication range.(Up to 3.5km@open area)
* Two-way communication.
* AES-CCM encryption featuring a random key.
* Instant notifications.
* Remote control via RB Link App.

### Frequency bands

* 868 MHz, 915 MHz, 433 MHz
  *Depends on sales region.*

### Maximum effective radiated power

* Up to 20 dBm
  Featured automatic power control to reduce power consumption and noise interference.

  *External antenna optional for places where built-in antenna signal is bad or no signal.*

### Wireless signal modulation

* FSK / DSSS

### Wireless signal range

* Up to 3,500m
  Between the hub and connected devices (in an open space).
  *Maximum range depends on the connected device.*

### Encrypted communication

All the data transmitted are protected by AES-CCM encryption with a random key.

### Frequency hopping (FHSS)

To prevent radio interference and radio signal interception.

> ### Recommendation:  The device operating voltage is DC5V 2A (Type-C)
>
> Home Security Hub is designed for indoor installation only.
