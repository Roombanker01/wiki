## 3. Add Door Magnetic Sensor

Please make sure you have logged into the RB Link App and completed adding the home security hub before adding peripheral.

1. Click Home Security Hub to enter peripheral page, then click "**+**" on the top right corner and select "**Add peripheral**" to enable enrollment mode.

2. Power up the door magnetic sensor by removing the insulator from the device .The green indicator will start flashing continuously and the device will automatically show up in the App interface.

   **Note: If the device does not show up in the App interface until green indicator is off, please press and hold the device register button for 5s to try again.*

3. Assign room for the door magnetic sensor and click the "**Done**" button ， the door magnetic sensor is added successfully.
